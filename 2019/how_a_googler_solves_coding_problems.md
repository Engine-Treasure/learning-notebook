# How a Googler solves coding problems

1. Draw it
   * Trying to start by immediately writing code is frankly a ridiculous and lazy idea.
   * Before you write a essay, you start by figuring out a hypothesis and evidence, and ensuring that the argument makes sense. (大纲, 蓝图的重要性)
   * Working it out on paper allows you to figure out a solution and verify that the solution works in a few different situations, all before even writing a single line of code. (在纸上写写画画, 能理清思路, 能考虑得更多更周到)
   * Just try to figure out how you, as a human computer, solve the problem. (假设你是人形计算机, 你会如何求解问题)
   * Draw pictures, arrows, numbers and whatever helps you visualize the problem (可视化问题).
   * When we write down algorithms, we need to make sure we express everything and handle all the possible scenarios. (从一开始就力求面面俱到)
2. Write it in English/Chinese
   * Write the algorithm out in natural language. This makes the steps concrete, so that we can refer back to it later when writing the code. (具体化算法)
3. Write pseudocode
   * Pseudocode mimics the structure of code. (伪代码模拟了最终代码的结构, 有点模块化代码的味道, 有利于最终实现)
4. Translate what you can code
   * Maybe you cannot write everything out, that's okay. Just write in the pieces you know. (先把会写的代码都写出来)
5. Don't guess
   * `The more pieces of your program you don't understand, the less likely you are to end up with the right solution` (对于你的程序, 你不懂的越多, 你离最终的解越远)
   * Test your new code first. Finding Finding something on the internet is great, but before you plug it into your program, test it in a small, separate space to make sure it works in the way that you think it does. (拿来主义并不可耻, 但是用之前, 你要理解它)
