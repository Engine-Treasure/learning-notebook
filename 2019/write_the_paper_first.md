# Write th Paper First

## Writing is the best use of limited time

> If you have to choose between clear writing and extensive experiments, pick writing

### Clear writing increases your odds of acceptance

- Clear motivation and exposition (阐述) are more important than results for getting your paper accepted.
- If you run out of time, it is better to have a great story with incomplete experiments than a sloppy (草率的) draft with complete experiments.
  - A good paper builds its case with the accumulated weight of several experiments, so missing a few is not fatal (and you can finish them for the camera-ready version).
  - A confusing, unconvincing, or incomplete writeup is fatal.
- Suppose you have to finish the paper on no sleep, which would you rather have left for the last minute, writing or hacking?
  - You can hack on little sleep, if you know what needs to be hacked. But you cannot write effectively. Writing involves many big and small decisions, which will seem insurmountable (难以克服的) when you're exhausted and panicked (恐慌的). (简而言之, 最后关头, 熬夜做实验或者写论文, 论文更难写好)
  - Students can be hacking in parallel at the last minute, but they cannot all be co-writing at the last minute.

### Clear writing increases the influence of your published paper

- There are two reasons a paper will be cited:
  1. A great implementation that people can just use as a black box, then they'll download it, use it, and cite you.
  2. The paper is only useful for the ideas that it provides (e.g. well-explained reusable techniques)
- The writeup is the research.
- The ideas in your paper will live on if they got picked up and used in other systems.
