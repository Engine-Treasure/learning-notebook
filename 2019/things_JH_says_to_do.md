# Things JH says to do

- Don't try to stop and understand everything
- Don't waste time, learn Jupyter keyboard shortcuts #!!!
- Run the code, really run the code, play with the code, see what goes in and what comes out
- Pick one project. do it really well, make it fantastic
- Run one notebook, but then get your own dataset and run it!
- If you have a lot of categories, don't run confusion matrix, run `interp.most_confused(min_val=n)`
- Follow the official server install/setup instructions.
- It's okay to feel intimidated (吓倒的), but just pick one piece and dig into it.
- If you're stuck (卡住), keep going
- If you're not sure which learning rate is best from plot, try both and see.
- When putting a model into production, you probabily want to use CPU for inference
- Get a small amount of data first, see how it goes
- If you use a dataset, it would be very nice of you to cite the creators and thank them
- Always use the same stats that the model was trained with
- If you're doing NLP stuff, make sure you use all the text you have to train your model
- If you want to play around, try to create your own `nn.linear` class
- One of the big oppotunities for research is to figure out how to do data augmentation for different domains, it is one of the biggest oppotunities that could let you decrease requirements by 5-10x
- Write code and put it on GitHub.
- Feel free to skip derivations/theorems/lemmas, they will add nothing to your understanding of pratical deep learning
- Read the parts where the authors talk about why they are solving this problem and the results
- Write summaries that will explain to you
- Perhaps the most important is to get together with others. Learning works a lot better if you have that social experience: start a book club, a study group, get involved in meetups, and build thinigs.
