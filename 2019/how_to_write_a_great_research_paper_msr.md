# How to write a great research  paper (MSR)

1. Don't wait: write
   * Writing paper model: idea -> write paper -> do research
   * The model:
     * Forces us to be clear, focused
     * Crystallizes (使明确) what we don't understand
     * Open the way to dialogue with others: reality check, critique, and collaboration
   * Writing papers is a primary mechanism for doing research (not just for reporting it)
2. Identify your key idea
   * Goal: to convey a **useful** and **re-usable** idea
     * You want to infect the mind of your reader with your idea, like a virus
     * Papers are far more durable (耐用的, 持久的) than programs
     * The greatest ideas are (literally) worthless if you keep them to yourself
   * Do not be intimidated
     * Write a paper, and give a talk, about any idea, no matter how weedy (瘦弱的, 似杂草的) and insignificant it may seem to you.
     * Write the paper is how you develop the idea in the first place. It usually turns out to be more interesting and challenging that it seemed at first
   * Idea: a re-usable insight, useful to the reader
     * Your paper should have just one "ping": `one clear, sharp idea`
     * You may not know exactly what the ping is when you start writing; but you must know when you finish
     * If you have lots of ideas, writes lots of papers
     * Many papers contain good ideas, but do not distill what they are.
     * Make certain that the reader is in no doubt what the idea is. Be 100% explicit:
       * "The main idea of this paper is ..."
       * "In this section we present the main contributions of the paper."
3. Tell a story
   * Narrative flow:
     * Imagine you are explaining at a whiteboard:
       1. Here is a problem
       2. It's an interesting problem
       3. It's unsolved problem
       4. Here is my idea
       5. My idea works (details, data)
       6. Here's how my idea compares to other people's approaches
   * Structure (conference paper)
     * Title (1000 readers)
     * Abstract (4 sentences, 100 readers)
     * Introduction (1 page, 100 readers)
     * The problem (1 page, 10 readers)
     * My idea (2 pages, 10 readers)
     * The details (5 pages, 3 readers)
     * Related work (1-2 pages, 10 readers)
     * Conclusion and further work (0.5 pages)
4. Nail your contributions to the mast
   * The introduction, 1 page
     * Describe the problem
       * Use an example to introduce the problem
       * It should be molehills not mountains
     * State your contribution
       * Write the list of contributions first
       * The list of contributions drives the entire paper: the paper substantiates the claims you have made
       * Reader thinks "gosh, if they can really deliver this, that's be exciting; I'd read on"
       * Do not leave the reader to guess what your contributions are!
         * Bulleted list of contributions
       * Contributions should be refutable (可驳倒的)
       * Evidence
         * Your introduction makes claims
         * The body of the paper provides **evidence to support each claim**
         * Check each claim in the introduction, identify the evidence, and forward-reference it from the claim
         * "Evidence" can be analysis and comparison. theorems, measurements, case studies
         * NO "rest of this paper is". INSTEAD, use forward references from the narrative in the introduction. The introduction (including the contributions) should survey the whole paper, and therefore forward reference (前向引用) every important part.
5. Related work: later
   * Put `related work` just before conclusion
   * Warmly acknowledge people who have helped you
   * Be generous to the competition
   * Acknowledge weakness in your approach
   * Giving credit to others does not diminish the credit you get from your paper
6. Put your readers first
   * Presenting the idea
     * Explain it as if you were speaking to someone using a whiteboard
     * Conveying the intuition is primary, not secondary
     * Once your reader has the intuition, she can follow the details (but not vice versa)
     * Even if she skips the details, she still takes away something valuable
   * Conveying the intuition
     * Introduce the problem, and your idea, using EXAMPLES, and only then present the general case
       * Explain it as if you were speaking to someone using a whiteboard
   * Do not recapitulate your personal journey of discovery. This route may be soaked with your blood, but that is not interesting to the reader
   * Choose the most direct route to the idea
7. Listen to your readers
   * Getting help
     * Experts are good
     * Non-experts are also very good
     * Each reader can only read your paper for the first time once. Use them carefully
     * Explain carefully what you want
     * Get your paper read by as many friendly guinea pigs as possible
   * Getting expert help
     * A good plain: when you think you are done, send the draft to the competition saying "could you help me ensure that I describe your work fairly"
     * Often they will respond with helpful critique
     * They are likely to be your referees anyway, so getting their comments or criticism up front is Jolly Good.
   * Listening to your reviewers
     * Treat every review like gold dust. Be (truly) grateful for criticism as well as praise
     * Read every criticism as a positive suggestion for something you could explain more clearly
     * Thank your reviewers warmly. They have given up their time for you.

## Language and Style

- Basic stuff 
  - Submit by the deadline
  - Keep to the length restrictions
    - Do no narrow the margins
    - Do not use 6pt font
    - On occasion, supply supporting evidence in a appendix (e.g. experimental data, or a written-out proof)
  - `Always use a spell checker`
- Visual structure
  - Give strong visual structure to your paper using
    - sections and subsections
    - bullets
    - italics
    - laid-out code
  - Find out how to draw pictures, and use them
- Use the active voice
  - The passive voice (被动语态) is "respectable" but it deadens your paper. Avoid it at all costs. (和老师的做法有点不一样)
- Use simple direct language
