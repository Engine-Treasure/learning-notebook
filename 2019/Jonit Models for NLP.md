Jonit Models for NLP

- Motivation
  - Related tasks in NLP
    - Constituents and named entities
    - NER, Chunking and POS Tagging
  - Pipelines in NLP
    - Segmentation => POS Tagging
    - Entity and Relation
    - Entity and Sentiment
  - Pros
    - Reduce error propagation
    - Allow information exchange between tasks
  - Challenges
    - Joint learning
    - Search #?
  - Solutions
    - 按两个维度: Search, Learning 可分成四个象限
      - Joint Learning + Joint Search: Statistical, Neural
      - Separate Learning + Joint Search: Statistical
      - Jont Learning + Separate Search: Neural
- Statistical Models
  - Graph-based methods
    - Traditional solution
      - Score each candidate, select the highest-scored output
      - Search-space typically exponential
    - Joint Label Structure (Joint Learning + Joint Search)
      - Joint Segmentation and POS tagging

      - Transition-based Dependency Parsing
        - Find the best sequence of actions, exponential (Beam-search decoding)
        - Learning guided search
          - Search not optional
